## PBKDF2 ðŸ”‘

### Overview

This Dart repository implements the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) as per [RFC 8018](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8018). PBKDF2 is a widely-used method for deriving cryptographic keys from passwords. It is particularly effective in thwarting brute-force attacks due to its use of salt and variable iteration counts.

### PBKDF2

PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function, such as HMAC, to the input password along with a salt value and repeats the process multiple times to produce a derived key. This key can then be used for secure data encryption.

#### Key Features:
- **Enhanced Security**: Increases resistance against brute-force attacks through the use of salt and iterations.
- **Customizable**: Allows for the selection of the hash function and adjustment of iteration counts based on security needs.
- **Versatile Application**: Suitable for a wide range of cryptographic applications, including encryption key generation and password hashing.

#### Best Practices:
- Use a sufficiently long and random salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.
- Set a high iteration count to increase the time required for brute-force attacks.

### Background and History

PBKDF2, standardized in RFC 8018, is an evolution in password-based cryptography, providing a method to safely derive cryptographic keys from passwords.

### RFC 8018

RFC 8018 provides comprehensive guidelines on the implementation and usage of PBKDF2. It outlines the algorithm's mechanics, emphasizing security considerations crucial for its effective application.

## Usage Examples

### Real-World Use Case: Key Generation for Encryption

**Scenario**: Generating a strong encryption key from a passphrase.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:pbkdf2/pbkdf2.dart';

Uint8List passphrase = ...; // User-provided passphrase
Uint8List salt = ...; // A unique salt
int iterations = 10000; // Standard iteration count
int keyLength = 32; // Key length for AES encryption

// Generate key
Uint8List encryptionKey = PBKDF2.deriveKey(passphrase, salt, iterations, keyLength);

// Use encryptionKey for cryptographic purposes
```
